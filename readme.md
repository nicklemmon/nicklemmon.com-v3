This project is for my portfolio re-design.

## Getting started
First run `npm install`, then `gulp` to build the site.

## Project Structure
Sass is structured using ITCSS as described by https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/ and https://medium.com/@jordankoschei/how-i-shrank-my-css-by-84kb-by-refactoring-with-itcss-2e8dafee123a#.gpc6n81a2.

The first two directories do not output any CSS.
